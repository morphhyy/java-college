## _User-Defined Packages in Java_

Packages in Java are a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages

`User-defined` packages are those packages that are designed or created by the developer to categorize classes and packages. They are much similar to the built-in that java offers. It can be imported into other classes and used the same as we use built-in packages. But If we omit the package statement, the class names are put into the default package, which has no name.

## _Syntax_:

```java
package package-name;
```
