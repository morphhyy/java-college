# _Chained Exception_
Chained exception in Java is a technique to handle exceptions that occur one after another. This technique helps us to know when one exception causes another.

For example, let us assume that a, b, and c are objects of three different exception types A, B, and C respectively. The object a of type A causes an exception of type B to occur and an object of B type also causes an exception of C type.
