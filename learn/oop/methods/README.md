# _A method is a block of code that performs a specific task_

## _In java, there are two types of methods:_
- ### User-defined Methods
    - creating your own methods
- ### Standard Libaray Methods
    - Java build-in methods

---
## Syntax:

```java
returntype methodName(){
    // body
}
```

- `returntype`
   
   returntype indicates what type of value you want to return.

- `methodName`

    it is an identifier that is used to refer a particular method name.
---
```java
modifier static returntype methodName(param1, ...){
    // body
}
```
 - `modifier` defines method access type i.e public, private..

- using `static`, you can access without creating an object.

-

## For Example:
```java
public String name(){
    return "morphy";
}
```

```java
public static int addNum(1,2){
    return a + b; 
}
```

## Standard Library Methods:
- `print()`
- `sqrt()`
