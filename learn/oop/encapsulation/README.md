## _Java Encapsulation_
_Encapsulation refers to the bundling of fields and methods inside a single class.It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing fields and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding._

## _Data Hiding_
Data hiding is a way of restricting the access of our data members by hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation also provides a way for data hiding.

We can use `access modifiers` to achieve data hiding.
